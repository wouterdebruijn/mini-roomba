# Mini Roomba
Creating a mini roomba for cleaning the top of your normal roomba! Or you could place it on a table. Up to you!

This project is part of a birthday present for a good friend of mine, which is why it started out as a private repo. The roomba is a shared project between me and another friend. 

I am planning on exporting STL files for the different parts, but the design is also available in the CAD software via https://cad.onshape.com/documents/26cafb76264ec7fcbd0478c6/w/78ab1585561d7516b7359f0c/e/5eb9d6ede1f5c00db7f6dd8d
